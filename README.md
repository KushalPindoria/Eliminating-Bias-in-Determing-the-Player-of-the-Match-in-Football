Eliminating Bias in Determining the Player of the Match in Football

Project Overview:

This project introduces a data-driven approach to eliminate bias in selecting the Player of the Match in football. Using a linear programming model, it standardizes player evaluation by integrating key performance metrics and position-specific weights to ensure a fair analysis of player contributions.

Key Features:

Position-Specific Weighting: Applies tailored weights to account for the varying contributions of players based on their roles (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward).
Bias Elimination: Reduces subjective bias by focusing on data-driven evaluations rather than opinions.
Real-World Application: Assists in talent identification, team strategy, and performance improvement in football.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python (for model implementation and data processing)
Data Analysis: Microsoft Excel (for datasets and statistical analysis)
Linear Programming: Applied in determining the optimal player contributions based on performance metrics

Applications:
This model offers enhanced insights for coaches, scouts, and analysts to make informed decisions on player selection, team tactics, and scouting.
